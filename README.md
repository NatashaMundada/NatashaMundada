# Portfolio

**Hello There! I'm Natasha, a passionate programmer, and a problem solver.**

I'm a computer science grad student at Northeastern University. I have 2+ years of industry experience in developing and deploying software.

I'm passionate about low-level programming, compiler design, CPUs, and operating system concepts. I believe embedded systems like CPUs, OS, etc. will get smarter with the increasing demand and high computational requirements of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning. And I would love to make a significant difference and take machine-level programming to the next level. 🤓

I write blogs on Medium about things I'm learning to help me understand the concepts better and share the knowledge.

# **My Education** :mortar_board:

:school:	**Master's in Computer Science**:- Pursuing my MS in Computer Sience from Northeastern University, Boston, MA. My courses are focused towards machine-level programming, operating systems and compilers. 
* Courses:- 
   * CS 5010:- Programming Design Paradigm
   * CS 5600:- Computer Systems
   * CS 5800:- Algorithms
   * CS 5200:- Database Management Systems

:school:	**Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering**:- I completed my B. Tech from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India (9.13 CPI). During my engineering course, I explored some new fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. Compiler Design, Operating Systems, and Theory of Computation were the other interesting subjects I deep-dived into during this degree course.

:school: **Diploma in Computer Engineering**:- I pursued a diploma from Government Polytechnic Jalgaon with 89.50% (I was the topper in my class). This course helped me strengthen my basics for computer science-related courses. It was a three-year course covering a broad variety of subjects like Data Structure, Operating Systems, Microprocessors, Java, C Programming, Computer Networks, etc.


# **Work Experience** 💻 

### **Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern University** 👩‍💻 (January 2023 - April 2023)
* Assisting professors Ferdinand Vesely and Ji-Yong Shin for the course CS 3650 :- Computer Systems. (https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3650sp23/)
* Mentoring a class of 200+ students by resolving doubts, providing guidance on C, operating systems, assembly language, Linux, and grading assignments.
* Skills:- C, x86, GDB, Linux, Operating System concepts, Make. 

### **Graduate Teaching Assistant at Northeastern University** 👩‍💻 (September 2022 - December 2022)
* Assisted professor Eli Barzilay for the course CS 4400/ 5400:- Programming Languages. (https://pl.barzilay.org)
* This course involves working with Racket and understanding the different aspects related to the development of a programming language. 
* As a graduate teaching assistant, I was responsible for conducting office hours to resolve doubts and grade assignments of a 80+ students class.
* Skills:- Racket, Programming Language, Compiler.

### **System Software Engineer at NVIDIA Graphics Pvt. Ltd.** 👩‍💻 (August 2020 - August 2022)
* I was part of the GVS (Gerrit Virtual Submit) team and my work involved working on security-related bugs, automating tasks using Shell script, Jenkins and delivering 15+ functionalities to users. 

* Auto-deployer for GVS Projects
  * Developed an auto-deployer to deploy Gerrit, AWS and Perforce-based projects on the target servers. The deployment process involved making database changes,and submitting/ deploying files on the large farm of machines, Kubernetes pods, and Docker containers.
  * Skills:- Kubernetes, Jenkins, Shell script

* nSpect and Coverity Vulnerability Fixes 
  * Helped fix different vulnerabilities related to maven jars and Coverity issues that might leak data or be vulnerable to attacks like DDoS.
  * Skills:- Coverity Scan, Maven. 

* Modification of GVS User Interface 
  * Delivered 15+ client requests which involved making changes to the IPP tracking platform to easily examine the failed/passing builds and packages. 
  * Skills:- Java, JSF, HTML.
 
* Perforce Security Projects
  * Successfully helped deliver multiple Perforce security projects. Perforce Unified Tickets security enhancement helped login using a single ticket hash for multiple perforce users, eliminating the need to maintain multiple P4 tickets.
  * Skills:- Perforce, Vault.

* Request for Evidence
  * Delivered 20+ client requests which involved making changes in the user interface to make test and package failures more readable.
  * Skills:- SQL, Java, JSF, HTML.

* TAT and Storage Optimization
  * Delivered a functionality that prevented users from uploading large artifacts that could cause storage difficulties. 
  * This feature was an individual project that aided in the optimization of storage systems and helped reduce TAT.
  * Developed Kibana dashboards to track the TAT optimization. 
  * Skills:- SQL, Java, Kibana.

### **Intern at NVIDIA Graphics Private Limited** 👩‍💻  (June 2019 - December 2019) 
* CI/CD Pipeline for Harness
  * A harness is a testing framework used to submit and test jobs on the target GPU board.
  * The submission and testing of the job were a manual, error-prone, and time-consuming process. I helped develop a CI/CD pipeline and a platform to do all these activities with minimal manual intervention. 
  * The user receives an email post the successful submission of tests with a detailed result report. 
  * Technology stack:- Jenkins, Python, Shell script. 
  * This project was well appreciated by the team. 

* Dockerization of Harness
  * Harness set up on any machine requires a great amount of manual effort. This setup also has challenges like package dependency, version mismatch, etc. 
  * The goal of this project was to develop a Docker image of Harness which can be used to create Docker Containers in any environment.



# **Things I like to do** 💻 
I will probably be solving Sudoku or a Rubik's cube, reading a book, or playing sports like table tennis, or badminton when I'm not working/studying.
