# Portfolio

**Hello, I'm Natasha Mundada.**

I'm passionate about low-level programming, compiler design and operating system concepts. I belive compilers will get smarter with the increasing demand and high computational requirements of Artificail Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. And I would love to contribute to make a significant differnce and take compiler and operating system to the next level. ü§ì

# **My Education** :mortar_board:

:school: **Diploma in Computer Engineering**:- I pursued diploma from Government Polytechnic Jalgaon with 89.50% (I was the topper of my class). This course helped me strengthen my basics for computer science-related courses. It was a three-year course covering a broad variety of subjects like Data Structure, Operating Systems, Mircroprocessors, Java, C Programming, Computer Networks, etc. 

:school:	**Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering**:- I completed my B.Tech from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India (9.13 CPI). During my engineering course, I explored some new fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning etc. Compiler Design, Operating Systems and Theory of Computation were the other interesting subjects I deep-dived into during this degree course. 


# **Work Experience** üíª 

### **Intern at NVIDIA Graphics Private Limited** üë©‚Äçüíª  (June 2019 - December 2019) 
* CI/CD Pipeline for Harness
  * Harness is a testing framework use to submit and test jobs on the target GPU board. 
  * The submission and testing of the job was a manual, error-prone and time consuming process. I helped develop a CI/CD pipeline and a platform to do all these activitites with minimal manual intervention. 
  * An user receives an email post the successful submission of tests with a detailed result report. 
  * Technology stack:- Jenkins, Python, Shell script. 
  * This project was well appreciated by the team. 

* Dockerization of Harness
  * Harness setup on any machine requires a great amount of manual effort. This setup also has challenges like package dependency, version mismatch, etc. 
  * The goal of this project was to develop a Docker image of Harness which can be used to create Docker Containers on any environment. 


### **System Software Engineer** üë©‚Äçüíª (August 2020 - Present)
* Automation of the deployments of Gerrit Virtual Submit (GVS)

I completed my computer engineering from VIT, Pune. I'm currently working as a System Software Engineer at NVIDIA, Pune. I've 2 years of experince of working on Java, Shell script, Jenkins and other CI/CD platforms, and Kubernetes. I helped automate multiple error-prone jobs which in turn saved time and manual effort. I have always been inclined towards C programming, assembly language. And this interest keeps me going on to explore more about the compiler world. Currently, I'm learning LLVM compiler and will soon write a short blog explaining LLVM and will include the sources I'm referring to. I also keep exploring other technologies, languages and try to develop some small side projects using those.
