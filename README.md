# Portfolio

**Hello, I'm Natasha Mundada.**

I'm passionate about low-level programming, compiler design, and operating system concepts. I believe compilers will get smarter with the increasing demand and high computational requirements of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. And I would love to contribute to making a significant difference and taking compiler and operating systems to the next level. ü§ì

Recently, I've started learning the LLVM compiler and its architecture. And as a part of this process, I'll write short articles explaining LLVM in my own words.

I've started writing blogs about things I'm learning, and exploring to help me understand the concepts better and share the knowledge.

# **My Education** :mortar_board:

:school: **Diploma in Computer Engineering**:- I pursued a diploma from Government Polytechnic Jalgaon with 89.50% (I was the topper in my class). This course helped me strengthen my basics for computer science-related courses. It was a three-year course covering a broad variety of subjects like Data Structure, Operating Systems, Microprocessors, Java, C Programming, Computer Networks, etc.

:school:	**Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering**:- I completed my B. Tech from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India (9.13 CPI). During my engineering course, I explored some new fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. Compiler Design, Operating Systems, and Theory of Computation were the other interesting subjects I deep-dived into during this degree course.



# **Work Experience** üíª 

### **Intern at NVIDIA Graphics Private Limited** üë©‚Äçüíª  (June 2019 - December 2019) 
* CI/CD Pipeline for Harness
  * A harness is a testing framework used to submit and test jobs on the target GPU board.
  * The submission and testing of the job were a manual, error-prone, and time-consuming process. I helped develop a CI/CD pipeline and a platform to do all these activities with minimal manual intervention. 
  * The user receives an email post the successful submission of tests with a detailed result report. 
  * Technology stack:- Jenkins, Python, Shell script. 
  * This project was well appreciated by the team. 

* Dockerization of Harness
  * Harness set up on any machine requires a great amount of manual effort. This setup also has challenges like package dependency, version mismatch, etc. 
  * The goal of this project was to develop a Docker image of Harness which can be used to create Docker Containers in any environment.


### **System Software Engineer** üë©‚Äçüíª (August 2020 - Present)
* I am part of the GVS (Gerrit Virtual Submit) team and working on automation, and security-related jobs. I've also contributed to developing many features requested by the customers.

# **Things I like to do** üíª 
I will probably be solving Sudoku, reading a book, or playing sports like table tennis, or badminton when I'm not working/studying.
