# Portfolio

**Hello, I'm Natasha Mundada.**

I'm passionate about low-level programming, compiler design, and operating system concepts. I believe compilers will get smarter with the increasing demand and high computational requirements of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. And I would love to contribute to making a significant difference and taking compiler and operating systems to the next level. ü§ì

Recently, I've started learning the LLVM compiler and its architecture. And as a part of this process, I'll write short articles explaining LLVM in my own words.

I've started writing blogs about things I'm learning to help me understand the concepts better and share the knowledge.

# **My Education** :mortar_board:

:school:	**Master's in Computer Science**:- Pursuing my MS in Computer Sience from Northeastern University, Bosto, MA. My courses are focused towards machine-level programming, operating systems and compilers. 
Courses:- 
CS 5010:- Programming Design Paradigm
CS 5600:- Computer Systems

:school:	**Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering**:- I completed my B. Tech from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, India (9.13 CPI). During my engineering course, I explored some new fields like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. Compiler Design, Operating Systems, and Theory of Computation were the other interesting subjects I deep-dived into during this degree course.

:school: **Diploma in Computer Engineering**:- I pursued a diploma from Government Polytechnic Jalgaon with 89.50% (I was the topper in my class). This course helped me strengthen my basics for computer science-related courses. It was a three-year course covering a broad variety of subjects like Data Structure, Operating Systems, Microprocessors, Java, C Programming, Computer Networks, etc.


# **Work Experience** üíª 

### **Graduate Teaching Assistant** üë©‚Äçüíª (September 2022 - Present)
* Assisting professor Eli Barzilay for the course CS 4400/ 5400:- Programming Languages. 
* This course involves working with Racket and understanding the different aspects related to the development of a programming language. 
* As a graduate teaching assistant, I'm responsible for conducting office hours to resolve doubts and grade assignments of a 80+ students class.
* Skills:- Racket, Programming Language, Compiler.

### **System Software Engineer** üë©‚Äçüíª (August 2020 - August 2022)
* I was part of the GVS (Gerrit Virtual Submit) team and my work involved working on security-related bugs, automating tasks using Shell script, Jenkins and delivering 15+ functionalities to users. 

* Auto-deployer for GVS Projects
  * Developed an auto-deployer to deploy Gerrit and Perforce-based projects on the target servers. The deployment process involved making database changes,
 and submitting/ deploying files on the large farm of machines, Kubernetes pods, and Docker containers.
  * Skills:- Kubernetes, Jenkins, Shell script

* nSpect and Coverity Vulnerability Fixes 
  * Helped fix different vulnerabilities related to maven jars and Coverity issues that might leak data or be vulnerable to attacks like DDoS.
  * Skills:- Coverity Scan, Maven. 

* Modification of GVS User Interface 
  * I assisted in fulfilling multiple client requests related to the platform IPP provides for examining failed/passing builds and packages using HTML, JSF, and JavaScript. Modifying the GVS user interface to make it more readable was one of the requests.
  * Skills:- Java, JSF, HTML.

* Threat Model for GVS Services
  * Helped developed threat models for services using Microsoft‚Äôs Threat Modeling Tool to identify different vulnerabilities, and threats in the workflow of a project.
  * Skills:- Microsoft Threat Model Tool
 
* Auto-deployer for AWS Projects
  * Some GVS projects are hosted on AWS for external users. Developed an auto-deployer to deploy changes on AWS and modify the database as per user requests.

* Perforce Security Projects
  * Successfully helped deliver multiple Perforce security projects. Perforce Unified Tickets security enhancement helped login using a single ticket hash for multiple perforce users, eliminating the need to maintain multiple P4 tickets.
  * Skills:- Perforce, Vault.

* Request for Evidence
  * Delivered 20+ client requests which involved making changes in the user interface to make test and package failures more readable.
  * Skills:- SQL, Java, JSF, HTML.

* TAT and Storage Optimization
  * Delivered a functionality that prevented users from uploading large artifacts that could cause storage difficulties. 
  * This feature was an individual project that aided in the optimization of storage systems and helped reduce TAT.
  * Developed dashboards to track the TAT optimization. 
  * Skills:- SQL, Java, Kibana.

* Kibana Dashboard
  * Created multiple Kibana dashboards for clients and internal usage to understand the TAT flow, package failures, service performance, etc.
  * These dashboards helped customers as well as the team to track the statistics more easily.

### **Intern at NVIDIA Graphics Private Limited** üë©‚Äçüíª  (June 2019 - December 2019) 
* CI/CD Pipeline for Harness
  * A harness is a testing framework used to submit and test jobs on the target GPU board.
  * The submission and testing of the job were a manual, error-prone, and time-consuming process. I helped develop a CI/CD pipeline and a platform to do all these activities with minimal manual intervention. 
  * The user receives an email post the successful submission of tests with a detailed result report. 
  * Technology stack:- Jenkins, Python, Shell script. 
  * This project was well appreciated by the team. 

* Dockerization of Harness
  * Harness set up on any machine requires a great amount of manual effort. This setup also has challenges like package dependency, version mismatch, etc. 
  * The goal of this project was to develop a Docker image of Harness which can be used to create Docker Containers in any environment.




# **Things I like to do** üíª 
I will probably be solving Sudoku or a Rubik's cube, reading a book, or playing sports like table tennis, or badminton when I'm not working/studying.
